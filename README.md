## Hunters Guide

The aim for this project is to provide an organised way to investigate ghosts in the game Phasmophobia. It will teach you the basic process that you should follow to be an efficient ghost hunter, along with useful tactics to help eliminate some evidence/ghosts for when the ghost is proving to be quite hesitant in giving away its identity.
There is also an items section that will give a brief description as to how the item works and tips on how to use that item.

This page is responsive and should fit nicely on most small tablets/smartphones.

### UI
Click the evidence buttons to select the evidence as being "discovered" and the ghost list will filter out any ghosts that do not have that evidence.

If you are 100% sure that you won't get a certain type of evidence then you can simply click the lock icon on the evidence button, this will filter out any ghosts that have that evidence.

To start a new investigation you can just click the red reset button at the top right.
